As discussed at the Tree-M general assembly we would like to start collecting which metadata information will be neccessary.

Please insert your ideas about what data and metadata to collect in the following [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uzlJNVqOQRBMsnC3wcb942BsrHxJJ-O1fSCaO2g20Vg/edit#gid=0).

Based on this information we can than discuss also what metadata to include in the ID.
